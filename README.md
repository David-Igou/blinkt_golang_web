# blinkt_go_web

Currently this is a simple WIP I wrote in the mountains with no internet

In the current state of this program, you configure webhooks and their behavior in `config.yml`

I plan on adding more features such as setting multiple LED's in a single call, blinking, and directly POSTing the state to a hook.
